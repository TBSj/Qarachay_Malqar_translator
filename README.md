# The first neural machine translation system for the Qarachay Malqar language on R
 
Authors: Bogdan Tewnalany, Ali Berberov

Created transformer model on R and trained it on 27235 parallel sentences between russian and Qarachay-Malqar languages. It is not enough for good prediction, result is bad. So, we used pre-trained model mbart-50 and fine-tuned it (TBSj/Qarachay_Malqar_translator_python).

Nowdays, we are collecting more sentences to improve our result.
